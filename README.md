  ## Description
  A simple NodeJS program that generates a professional README markdown file based on user input. Use this to create a full README or a template to get you started. Even this README was made with the program! This program utilizes the Inquirer package to prompt the user through the command line. 

  ## Installation
  To install this program simply clone the repo from GitHub using the following command, git clone git@github.com:DominiqueGarrett/readme-generator.git â€” You can then use the command npm i to download the projects npm dependencies (npm i inquirer@8.2.4). Currently, that is just Inquirer. Once you have done that you are all set! Now you can run the program with the command node index.js.

  ## Usage
  After using the node index.js command, running the app is simple! You will be given a number of prompts to answer. Once you answer all of the questions the README.md file will be created in your project.
